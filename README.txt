Initially, a review of the literature provided as a reference was conducted, and each of us reviewed one article and then reported it to classmates:


* Andrea Rachele Aparo → Leeb R et al. Transferring brain–computer interfaces beyond the laboratory: Successful application control for motor-disabled users. Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 59(2):121-32, 2013. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2013.08.004

Subsequently, we held several meetings, in which all group members always participated, to define the work schedule to be followed in writing matlab codes; in the following meetings, the codes were always viewed together, and the results thereof.
Andrea Rachele Aparo, Francesco Pio Monaco and Lorenzo Sterzi dedicated themselves to writing the different parts of code, while Virginia Furlani and Anna Pegreffi took care of writing the final report. 


However, we would like to emphasize that all phases of the project have always been carried out as a team, with the help of each member.
